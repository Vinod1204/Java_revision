Java uses automatic memory management system called Garbage Collection(GC) to manage memory effeciently.
It eliminates the need for developers to manually allocate and deallocate memory.
Ensuring that the application runs without memory leak or invalid memory accesses.

Garbage Collection:
Process of recliaming memory occupied by objects that are no longer accessible in application.
The JVM automatically identifies and removes such objects.

How GC works:
1.Mark Phase:
Identifies objects that are still in use/reachable by traversing from root references.

2.Sweep/Compact Phase:
Removes objects that are no longer reachable.
Compacts memory t avoid fragmentation(optional depending on the GC algorithm).
