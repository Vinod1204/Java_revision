Java application use the Java Virtual Machine(JVM), which manages memory in two primary areas:
1.Heap Memory : Store objects and class instances.
2.Stack Memory : Stores methods calls, local variables, and references to objects.

Memory Structure in Java:
1.Method Area:
*Stores class metadata ,static variables and runtime constant pool.
*shared among all threads

2.Heap:
*Stores objects and JRE classes
*Divided into 
 
 *Young Generation: New;y created objects(short-lived)
    Eden Space : Where objects are initially allocated.
    Survivor Space S0 & S1 : Holds objects that survived one or more garbage collection cycles.
 
 *Old Generation:(tenured)
    Long-lived objects that survived multiple GC cycles.

 *Humongous Region: Stores large objects (larger than 50% of the region size).

3.Stack:
    .Stores method calls,local variables and reference variables.
    .Each thread gets its own thread.

4.PC register:
    Keeps track of the address of the current instruction for each thread.

5.Native Method Stack:
    Used for Native method execution
