Polymorphism in object-oriented programming refers to the abiility of a single function, method, operator to behave differently based on the context in which it is used.

Polymorphism is classified into two main types:

1.Compile time polymorphism ( Static polymorphism )
2.Run time polymorphism ( Dynamic polymorphism )
