Polymorphism: Ability to take many forms.

Compile-Time Polymorphism: Achieved via method overloading. The method to invoke is determined at compile time.

Runtime Polymorphism: Achieved via method overriding. The method to invoke is determined at runtime.

Method Overloading: Same method name, different parameters.

Method Overriding: Same method signature in the parent and child classes.
