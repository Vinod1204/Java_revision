Unlike languages such as C++, Java does not support operator overloading. 
However, some operators (like +) can behave differently in Java (e.g., for addition and string concatenation).

Code:

int a = 5, b = 10;
String s1 = "Hello", s2 = "World";

System.out.println(a + b);       // Outputs: 15 (Addition)
System.out.println(s1 + s2);     // Outputs: HelloWorld (Concatenation)
