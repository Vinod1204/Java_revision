Definition:
Run time polymorphism is achieved by method overidding.
The method to be executed is determined at runtime.
It typically involves the inheritance and a superclass reference to a subclass object.

Code:
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal;

        // Runtime decision to call the overridden method
        animal = new Dog();
        animal.sound(); // Outputs: Dog barks

        animal = new Cat();
        animal.sound(); // Outputs: Cat meows
    }
}


Output:
Dog barks
Cat meows
