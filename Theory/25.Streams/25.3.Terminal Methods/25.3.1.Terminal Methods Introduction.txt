Terminal Methods
Terminal operations trigger the computation of the stream pipeline and produce a result or a side effect.

Common Terminal Methods:
forEach(Consumer<T>): Performs an action for each element.
collect(Collector): Collects the elements into a collection or other data structure.
reduce(BinaryOperator<T>): Reduces elements to a single value.
count(): Counts the number of elements.
findFirst() / findAny(): Finds the first or any element.
