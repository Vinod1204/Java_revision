Intermediate Methods:
These methods transform a stream into another stream. 
They are lazy, meaning no computation is performed until a terminal operation is encountered.

Common Intermediate Methods:
filter(Predicate<T>): Filters elements based on a condition.
map(Function<T, R>): Transforms each element.
flatMap(Function<T, Stream<R>>): Flattens nested streams into a single stream.
distinct(): Removes duplicate elements.
sorted(): Sorts the elements.
limit(long n): Limits the number of elements.
skip(long n): Skips the first n elements.
