Parallel Streams
Parallel streams divide the data into multiple chunks and process them in parallel, utilizing the available CPU cores. 
They are suitable for computationally intensive tasks.

Creating a Parallel Stream:

Using parallelStream():
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);

Converting a Stream to Parallel:
Stream<Integer> stream = numbers.stream();
stream.parallel().forEach(System.out::println);

Benefits of Parallel Streams:
Speeds up tasks by using multiple threads.
Automatically manages thread creation and synchronization.

Important Note:
Use Parallel Streams for Large Data: Parallelism adds overhead; for small datasets, sequential streams are often faster.
Thread-Safety: Ensure that operations on shared resources are thread-safe when using parallel streams.

When to Use Parallel Streams?
Large datasets where processing can be divided into smaller tasks.
Computations that are independent (e.g., calculating the square of each number).
Avoid parallel streams for:
Small datasets (overhead of parallelism outweighs benefits).
State-dependent computations (thread-safety issues).
