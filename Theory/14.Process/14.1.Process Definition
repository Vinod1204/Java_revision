Process is a indepedent in execution, it will not share the memory and resources with other process.
Each process run its own memory space, one process cannot du=irectly access to the other process.
Inter process communication is required to share between process.

Characteristics of Process:
1.Independent execution.
2.Heavy Weight
3.Memory Isolation
4.Inter process communication
5.Running two java programs on your machine create two separate process.They do not share memory or resources directly.

Program 1:
public class Process1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Process 1: " + i);
        }
    }
}

Program 2:
public class Process2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Process 2: " + i);
        }
    }
}
When you run these two programs, each program creates a separate process. They do not share memory or resources directly.
