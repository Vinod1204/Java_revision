Objects:
Instance of a class.
When you create an object, you allocate memory for the class and assign values to its fields.

1.	An object is a real-world entity, like a car, dog or book.
2.	It has state (data stored in fields) and behavior ( methods).

To create an object, use the new keyword followed by a call to the class constructor.
Person person1=new Person(“Vinod”, 23);
