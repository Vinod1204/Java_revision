Definition:
Context switch occurs when CPU switches from one thread to another.
It involves the saving the state of current executing thread and loading the state of next thread to be executed.

This switching allows multiple threads to share the CPU and makes it seem like they are running simultaneously, even on a single-core processor.

Steps in Context Switching
Save State: The state of the current thread (like registers, program counter, etc.) is saved.
Load State: The state of the new thread is loaded.
Execution: The CPU starts executing the new thread.
