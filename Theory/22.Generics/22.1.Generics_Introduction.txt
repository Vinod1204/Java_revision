Definition:
Generics were introducted in java 5 to provide a way to ensure a type safety while working with collections and any other types of objects.
They allow you to define class, interface and methods as a placeholder for the type of data they operate on.

Why Generics:
1.Type safety : They prevent ClassCastException by checking types at compile time.
2.Code Reusability : Write a single class or method that works with different datatypes.
3.Cleaner Code : No need for explicit type casting.

How Generics Work?
Generics introduce type parameters. For example:

<T> -> Represents a type parameter ( eg : String, Integer..etc)
<k, V> -> Represents multiple type parameters ( commonly used in map)
