Definition:
Executing multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple cores in a multicore processors.
Speeding up task completion by dividing and executing the task  at the same time.

Analogy: Multiple chefs working on different dishes on same time.

Use Parallelism:
When tasks can run independently and you need to speed up execution.
For data processing tasks that benefit from splitting workloads.
Example: Performing mathematical computations on large datasets.
