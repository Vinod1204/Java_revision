Definition:

Callable is a generic functional interface with a single method, call().
It returns a result and can throw checked exceptions.

Purpose:
For defining tasks that need to return a result or throw exceptions.

Usage:
Typically used with ExecutorService.


Use Callable:
When tasks are complex, need to return a result, or might throw checked exceptions.
Example: Fetching data from a database or performing computationally intensive tasks.

Callable is more flexible and designed for tasks that need to return a value or handle exceptions.
