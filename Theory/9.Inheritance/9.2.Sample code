Code:
class Animal { // Parent Class
    String name;

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal { // Child Class
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.name = "Buddy"; // Access inherited field
        dog.eat(); // Call inherited method
        dog.bark(); // Call subclass method
    }
}

Output:
Buddy is eating.
