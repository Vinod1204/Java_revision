Fundamental concepts in Object oriented Programming(OOP).
Where one class( child or sub class ) acquires the properties ( fields) and methods of another class( parent or superclass)

It promotes code reusability and establish the relationship between the classes

Key features:
The extend keyword is used to establish the Inheritance.
The subclass inherits all the public and protected members of the supercalss does not inherit the private members.

A subclass can inherits members directly.
A subclass can override methods from the parent class to specific behavior.
