Bundling Data (variables ) and methods ( functions ) that operates on the data into a single unit, usually a class.
Via access modifiers we can restrict direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components.
Key Features:
1.	Data hiding -> internal details of a class are hidden from the outside world.
2.	Access control -> Access to variables and methods using access modfiers.
a.	Private -> Access to only within the same class
b.	Protected -> Access within package and by subclass
c.	Public 	-> Access from anywhere 
d.	Default -> Access within the same package.
3.	Getter and Setter methods -> used to provide access to private variables.
