Introduction:
Part of java'8 Stream API, parallel stream automatically divide tasks and execute them in parallel on multicore processors.

Code:
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = IntStream.range(1, 101)
                .parallel()
                .sum();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Output: 5050
    }
}

Output: 
5050

Explanation: The .parallel() method divides the range into parts that execute concurrently across multiple cores.
