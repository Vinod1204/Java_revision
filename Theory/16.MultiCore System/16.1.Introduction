Multicore Systems
A multicore system is a type of computer architecture where a single processor contains multiple processing cores (CPUs). 
Each core is capable of performing independent tasks or collaborating on the same task, enabling parallel processing.

This architecture improves performance, energy efficiency, and the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
