The final keyword is used to restrict the behaviour of varaibles,methods and classes.

Types:
*Final Variable -> Used to define constants ( final double PI=3.14 )
*Final Method   -> Used when method's implementation is critical should not be overridden.
*Final Class    -> Used for utility clases like java.lang.String to prevent modification through inheritance.
