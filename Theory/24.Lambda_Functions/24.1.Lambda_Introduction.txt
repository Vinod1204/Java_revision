Lambda Functions in Java
Lambda functions, introduced in Java 8, are a concise way to represent anonymous functions (functions without a name).
They allow you to write more readable and maintainable code, especially for functional-style programming.

Syntax:

(parameters) -> (Expressions)

parameters : The input of the function can be empty if none are required.
Arrow( -> ) Separates the parameters from the function body.
Expression or Block : The body of the lambda can be a single statement or block of code.

Key Points:
Lambda functions are primarily used with functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method).
They can simplify code by replacing verbose anonymous inner classes.
